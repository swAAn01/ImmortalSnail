# ImmortalSnail
Adds the legendary Immortal Snail as an enemy.

When spawned, the snail selects the nearest player and slowly moves towards them, killing them instantly on contact.
Then it chooses closest living player as its next target.
If the snail touches a non-targeted player, that player will be unaffected.

All players in a lobby must have the mod installed.

As of version 0.3.0, there are now configuration options through LethalConfig! Use the sliders to determine the size, speed, and allowed number of snails. The host's settings will be used for the game, and a restart of the game client is required after changing settings.

Feel free to reach out on Discord (bigswandawg) for bug reports or suggestions!
