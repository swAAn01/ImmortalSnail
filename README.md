# ImmortalSnail
Adds the legendary Immortal Snail as an enemy.

When spawned, the snail selects the nearest player and slowly moves towards them, killing them instantly on contact.
Then it chooses the closest living player as its next target.
If the snail touches a non-targeted player, that player will be unaffected.
If a snail's target is outside and the snail is inside (and vice versa), the snail will path towards the nearest entrance and chase the target player outside.

# Configuration
Several config options are available for this mod including:
* Size
* Speed
* Max Snails Spawned
* Rarity
* Can Go Outside
* Can Enter Ship
* Can Explode
* Explosions Kill Other Players
* Gary Mode <3
* Show Target When Scanned

New as of Version 0.7.4:
* Kill any player

Config options will default to the hosts configuration. Compatible with LethalConfig.

It is recommended that you DO NOT change any pathing settings while landed. This can cause
some weird untested behaviors.

All players in a lobby must have the mod installed.
