# ImmortalSnail
Adds the legendary Immortal Snail as an enemy.
When spawned, the snail selects the nearest player and slowly moves towards them, killing them instantly on contact. Then it chooses closest living player as its next target. If the snail touches a non-targeted player, that player will be unaffected.
